        <p class="section">[Mini Intro]</p>
        <p>Real ones only, no fake vibes...<br />Trending Boss... this one’s from the heart.</p>

        <p class="section">[Intro]</p>
        <p>(Yeah)<br />(Trending)<br />Uh<br />This that real life story<br />Pain turned power<br />Listen</p>

        <p class="section">[Verse 1]</p>
        <p>
          I came up from nothin’, had to fight for the meal...<br />
          Mom’s still prayin’, tryna hope that I heal<br />
          Lost a few friends, now I’m cold with the steel<br />
          Pain in my heart, but I smile for the deal<br />
          I was broke in the rain, no umbrella<br />
          Now I step clean, Margiela<br />
          Talkin’ 'bout love, man, I don’t feel nothin’<br />
          These days, I only trust cheddar (Grrt, bow)<br />
          Late nights, still hearin’ them sirens<br />
          Feds on the block, try'na cage my guidance<br />
          PTSD got me movin' in silence<br />
          Say they real but I know they lyin’<br />
          Fake love tryna drain my spirit<br />
          Said they wit’ me but I don’t feel it<br />
          Cut ‘em off, no hate, just clearance<br />
          God’s plan, man, I’m still winnin’
        </p>

        <p class="section">[Pre-Chorus]</p>
        <p>
          They say they real, but the loyalty's missin'...<br />
          In the field, boy, it’s cold, no mittens<br />
          Lost my soul, but I prayed and I listened<br />
          Turned my pain to the strength, now I'm liftin' (Now I'm liftin')
        </p>

        <p class="section">[Chorus]</p>
        <p>
          They don't know what I’ve been through...<br />
          Pray for my dawgs and my kin too<br />
          Hard on ice, but I grin too<br />
          Made it out the mud, that’s a big move (That’s a big move)<br />
          They don't know what I’ve been through (They don’t know)<br />
          Pray for my dawgs and my kin too (Pray for my dawgs)<br />
          Hard on ice, but I grin too<br />
          Made it out the mud, that’s a big move (Big moves only)
        </p>

        <p class="section">[Verse 2]</p>
        <p>
          I was prayin’ for a change when the nights got colder...<br />
          Young boy had to move like a soldier<br />
          Heart got numb as the world got colder<br />
          Ops on my back and the weight on my shoulder<br />
          Remember them nights, one jacket, two brothers<br />
          Splittin’ one meal, had to share with each other<br />
          Now when we link, it's designer and covers<br />
          But still got the pain in the roots of my mother (Roots of my mother)<br />
          Lost bro, now I'm movin’ with vengeance<br />
          Told brodie, "One day, we’ll be legends"<br />
          Seen man switch for a lil' bit of mentions<br />
          I don’t trust words, only move on intentions<br />
          Cold world, but I’m heating the section<br />
          Bad energies, man, I duck and I dead them<br />
          Smile on my face but my heart still question<br />
          If they riding or plotting deception
        </p>

        <p class="section">[Bridge] (Slow it down)</p>
        <p>
          Still healing inside...<br />
          Still fighting these fights...<br />
          Still prayin’ at night (still prayin’ at night)<br />
          One day, it'll be alright (One day it'll be alright...)
        </p>

        <p class="section">[Chorus]</p>
        <p>
          They don't know what I’ve been through...<br />
          Pray for my dawgs and my kin too<br />
          Hard on ice, but I grin too<br />
          Made it out the mud, that’s a big move (That’s a big move)<br />
          They don't know what I’ve been through (They don’t know)<br />
          Pray for my dawgs and my kin too (Pray for my dawgs)<br />
          Hard on ice, but I grin too<br />
          Made it out the mud, that’s a big move (Big moves only)
        </p>

        <p class="section">[Verse 3] (final verse, victorious tone)</p>
        <p>
          Now it's business class when we flyin'...<br />
          No more stress, mom's smilin'<br />
          No more pain when I’m signin’<br />
          Turned all the Ls to diamonds<br />
          Talked to the stars, they shinin’<br />
          Worked in the dark, now I'm blinded<br />
          Haters talk, but I'm climbin’<br />
          Trending Boss, now I'm timin’<br />
          Coulda lost it all, but I stayed on the mission<br />
          No sleep, no breaks, had the vision<br />
          Pain turned power, now I’m movin' with precision<br />
          Still thank God, every day, no missin’ (Thank God)<br />
          Man, I’m healing<br />
          Old wounds, but the new life gleamin’<br />
          Big house, big plans, big dreamin’<br />
          Still humble though, still schemin'
        </p>
